	<h3>How I started </h3>
    <p> I started climbing October 2024, and have loved it ever since! I started climbing after my sister got a pass to momentum with her friend. Every time she came home after climbing, she would be so happy, and it made me want to climb. Eventually my brother and I convinced our parents and we got a momentum pass.   </p>
    <h3>Spotlight: My sister</h3>
    <p>My sister is my number one inspiration for climbing. She is the one who got me started and she keeps climbing even if she gets frustrated which is a great example for me. She started climbing with her friend at momentum and later got more of her friends to start climbing. At momentum every month you get a guest pass that you can use on whoever you want and she used her guest passes to get people intrested in climbing.  </p>
    <h3>Accomplishments </h3>
    <ul> 
      <li> Did a V4 bouldering (when you climb with no rope)</li>
      <li> Did a 5.11c top roping (when you climb with a rope) </li>

 </ul>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Rock climbing started to try to summit peaks and got recognized as a sport in June 1886 by Haskett Smith. </p>  
   <h3>Road bumps along the way </h3>
    <p>Recently I was very sick and it made it so I couldn't go climbing. This definitely took a toll on my skill level. Before I got sick I was doing V3s and 4s and am now at V1s and 2s. This was really frustrating but my sister told me to not give up. I listen to her advice and have now started to improve. </p>
<h3>Momentum</h3>
	  <p>A great place to go climbing is momentum. They have classes that you can take to get you belay certified and have a variety of climbs that they change often.  </p>
